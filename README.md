# Smart.House.IoT.Project
This project was made with a NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi module, Raspberry Pi4, Temp and Humidity sensor, Flame sensor, Photoresistor, RGB LED and a Buzzer.

This link will take you to the tutorial explaining how to manipulate the Yocto Project and how to build the custom Linux distro:

You can replace the home router with a SmartPhone Hotspot.
I got the sensors in the 37 arduino sensors kit from 2bTrading.
